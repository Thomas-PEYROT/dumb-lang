# DUMB Language

This repo contains the source code of the **DUMB Language**. It's a personal project made to have a better understanding of
how interpreters and compiler works. "DUMB" is the acronym of "Don't Use Me Bro" (because it shouldn't be used in 
production), and, well... it's quite funny because it also means "dumb" I guess...
